      Here are 5 steps to boost your mental health - 
      
      1.	Better sleep 
      2.	Meditation 
      3.	Cut off social media 
      4.	Eat healthily 
      5.	Exercise 
      
      Whenever you try to learn new things like riding a bike or playing a game it seems too time-consuming because you have to go through the process and follow the procedures. Improving your mental health is also not a task in a single day. You have to self-analyze yourself, take it as a challenge, and follow your plans day by day. You can either follow a 7-day challenge or a 21-day challenge or schedule your plans as per your priorities. The most important thing in this process is to keep yourself motivated & appreciate yourself daily after every successful completion of a day.

      In the current competing and challenging world, it is quite difficult to achieve what we want to pursue. Whether you call it a goal, ambition, or whatever but nowadays meaning varies from person to person 
      For some material and financial gains is success and for some mental growth, mindfulness along with stable career growth is their definition of success. What is your definition of success? 
      
      Anyway, let us get deeper into it, if you look around you & try to observe the current scenario you may observe that right from an early age itself we are taught to focus on continuous learning about lots of stuff to become this to that. We are prepared to learn things consistently despite our interests. 
      We are given different scenarios & outlooks along with some reward reinforcements which trigger the mind that if you cannot learn you may fail, you may be unsuccessful, and you are unvalued.

      Life as a young adult isn’t easy. It takes a lot to make it in the world, and it takes even more to maintain your status as an adult. To succeed in life as an adult, you’ll need to know how to build positive relationships that last. You’ll need to build an inner circle of those who will help you through challenging times in your life. These relationships are built not only with friends and family members, but also colleagues and coworkers at work.

Young adults are still trying to figure out who they are, what they want to do with their lives, and where they fit into this big picture of humanity.

        The young adult years can be a time of great change for those who choose to live them well; however, there’s also much uncertainty involved in becoming an adult at any age. So while these years might seem like an exciting time in life when compared with childhood or adolescence (or even adulthood), they also have their challenges as well!

You were left alone to figure out how to make sense of this new world without their guidance.

I am a self-taught guy, I have no formal education but only a passion for learning and exploring new things. I started my career as a trader in the stock market and after 4-5 months I start to do other things like content creation, graphic designing, and freelancing.

The societal outlook affects lots of youth as they always put youth in a situation where he/she can't find their interest and rather start doing things they won't like just because of pressure from family and friends. This can be a nightmare because it will make them feel bad and they will never find their interest. The youth need to be given the space to do what they like and what makes them happy."
